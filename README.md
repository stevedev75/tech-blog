## Application to build a "Tech Blog" application using the MVC model. 

My motivation for this project was to build the front end (using Handlebars, CSS and JavaScript) and back end (using JavaScript, Express.JS, Sequelize and a mysql database "Tech Blog". 

I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of JavaScript, Sequelize, MySql and Handlebars.  

This application solves the problem often of how to build the front end and back end of a website that connects to a database.

In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- more about Sequelize, MySQL, databases, Handlesbars and additional information about JavaScript.

Please see the deployed application on Heroku:
